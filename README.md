# PH1012-GDP-Sim

### Golf simulation for the GDP in PH1012.  

The file to run is "GDP_Sim.py".

For help running the simulation, see the video I posted on Teams.

Variables like the drag coefficient, gravity, etc. can be changed in "data/constants.py"

Functionality will (hopefully) be added in the future.
